# Inventory Management System This project is an Inventory Management System designed to track and manage inventory items across warehouses, orders, and users. ## Description The Inventory Management System consists of the following core resources: 1. **Warehouse**: Represents the physical locations where inventory is stored. 2. **Product**: Represents the individual products or items being managed in the inventory. 3. **Order**: Represents a request to purchase or move inventory. 4. **User**: Represents individuals who interact with the inventory management system (e.g., customers, staff). Each resource has relationships with other resources, allowing for the tracking, storage, and movement of inventory items across various locations and orders.
